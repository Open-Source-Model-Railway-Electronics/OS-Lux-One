# OS-Lux-One

The OS-Lux-One is an open-source modular LED lighting strip for digital model railway systems 
It replaces multiple fixed-length coach strips with one universal version that can be shortened and reused for different coach types.
Each strip section contains its own current control to keep the light level steady, even when the track voltage changes.
The design is suitable for both H0 and N scale rolling stock.
